# Recipe App

The Recipe App is a console-based application that allows users to manage recipes, including entering recipe details, displaying recipes, scaling recipes, resetting ingredient quantities, and clearing all data.

## Features

The Recipe App provides the following features:

1. **Enter recipe details**: Users can enter the name of the recipe, the number of ingredients, and the number of steps. They can then input the details for each ingredient and step, including the name, quantity, unit of measurement, calories, and food group.

2. **Display recipe list**: Users can view a list of all the entered recipes in alphabetical order. The list displays the names of the recipes.

3. **Display recipe details**: Users can select a recipe from the list and view its details, including the name, ingredients (with quantity, unit, and name), steps, and the total calories of the recipe. If the total calories exceed 300, a warning message is displayed.

4. **Scale recipe**: Users can select a recipe and scale it by entering a scaling factor of 0.5, 2, or 3. This scales the quantities of all ingredients in the recipe accordingly.

5. **Reset quantities**: Users can select a recipe and reset the quantities of all ingredients to their original values. The original quantities are retrieved based on the ingredient names.

6. **Clear all data**: Users can clear all entered recipe data, including recipes, ingredients, and steps.
